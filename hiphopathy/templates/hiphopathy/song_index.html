                In our case, we will use an heuristic to focus our attention. Since one of the goals of
                this project is understanding how we reason about conceptual metaphors, we will use knowledge of conceptual
                metaphor research in natural language understanding to guide our solution<sup>1</sup>. In that field, they follow
                the heuristic of focusing on noun and verb phrases, with particular attention to action verbs.<br>
